#Write a program that asks the user to enter a personâ€™s age.
#The person should display a message indicating whether the
#person is an infant, a child, a teenager, or an adult.
#Follow these guidelines:
#If the person is 1 year old or less, he or she is an infant.
#If the person is older than one year,
#but younger than 13 years, he or she is a child.
#If the person is at least 13 years old,
#but less than 20 years old, he or she is a teenager.
#If the person is at least 20 years old, he or she is an adult.
